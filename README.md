#Features

##Status updates

Users can update their status by searching their mood (i.e. right now i'm...hungry) and selecting a giphy gif. The status is then available to see by anyone in any of their groups.

##Groups

Users can create and invite people to groups. A user can only see statuses and messages from people they are in a group with.

##Messages

Users can "comment" on each other's statuses with a message. Messages are threaded, but only two deep. So an initial message can happen then any user who is in a group with that user can converse "on" that message.

##Feed

The app is really just a feed of statuses, where the newest statuses filter to the top. The entire feed is filterable by group. Users can also see historical statuses by a user in the feed.

#Todos
